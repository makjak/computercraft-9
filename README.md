# n3rdgir1's Computercraft Code

These are my running computer programs. I'm keeping them as a repository for managing them between servers so I never really lose anything. I'm integrating with [my pastebin](http://pastebin.com/u/n3rdgir1) to get them to the servers. Hopefully I'll keep this up to date as I go.

## Startup program

* This program will automatically load my scaffold program which has all my utils

## Helpful Tidbits

* Always name your devices (computers, turtles, disks), otherwise you will lose all programs when you move them.
 * Name your device using the command `label set your_name_here`
* Don't be upset when your turtle wanders off into the abyss, it's only doing what you told it to do
 * Test small in a controlled environment
