# N3rdgir1's Computercraft Code

These are my Computercraft programs for Tekkit Lite.

These can be used as a place to start, or in your game.

The computer files are located in saves/Your Save File/computer

There are 2 files you should never edit:
* labels.txt
* lastid.txt

Labels.txt will be map the names of the device to the folder they are in.
Lastid.txt is apparently useful to the Computercraft.

## Helpful Tidbits

* Always name your devices (computers, turtles, disks), otherwise you will lose all programs when you move them.
* Name your device using the command `label set your_name_here`
* Don't be upset when your turtle wanders off into the abyss, it's only doing what you told it to do
