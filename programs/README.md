# Programs

Working programs with basic descriptions included here.

## Branch

This file will dig forward and dig a three tall tunnel (centered around turtle), and return based on the following conditions:

* The turtle has enough fuel to get back
* The turtle's inventory is not full
* The turtle has enough torches (safety first)

This program must be installed in a mining turtle and you must place torches in the bottom right corner (slot 16).

## Tutorial

This is my tutorial program for getting started with programming in Minecraft in Lua for use at talks.
